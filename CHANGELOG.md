# Changelog

## Release 0.0.56

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## Release 0.0.55 - 2022-07-08

### Added

- Singlesig: Implement GA_get_previous_addresses
- Singlesig: Allow fetching internal addresses in GA_get_receive_address using "is_internal"=true
- Added new function GA_get_credentials, to replace GA_get_mnemonic_passphrase.
- Added new function GA_encrypt_with_pin, to replace GA_set_pin.
- Added new function GA_get_assets to query data related to a set of Liquid
  assets.
- Added bip39 passphrase support.

### Changed

- GA_get_previous_addresses: To get the newest generated addresses, caller should not include "last_pointer" key (instead of passing "last_pointer" 0). If the returned json does not have the "last_pointer" key, it indicates that all addresses have been fetched (previously it had "last_pointer" 1)
- GA_get_previous_addresses: Removed "subaccount" from returned keys.
- Singlesig: Add some missing fields to GA_get_receive_address returned json.
- Singlesig: Remove is_segwit from GA_get_unspent_outputs returned json
- GA_register_user: Change interface to match GA_login_user.
- Update endpoints for new bitcoin multisig backend.

### Fixed

- GA_get_unspent_outputs: fix bug returning utxos from replaced transactions.

### Removed

- Removed GA_get_mnemonic_passphrase, callers should use GA_get_credentials.
- Removed GA_set_pin, callers should use GA_encrypt_with_pin.
- Removed LTO and bitcode building flags.

- Singlesig: align transaction and block notifications with multisig
- Singlesig: temporarily lock spent utxos in the interval between send/broadcast and the next sync
- Singlesig: fix an error causing "restore" to fail


## Release 0.0.52 - 2022-04-22

- Singlesig: In GA_create_transaction "transaction_outputs" make "is_change" equal to "is_internal", not "is_relevant"

### Fixed
